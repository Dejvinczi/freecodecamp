## My [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) course solutions

This repository contains my solutions from the React course I've completed. Here you'll find my implementations of various projects and challenges, organized by course sections. Each project demonstrates different React concepts I've mastered, from basic static pages to complex state management and side effects.

> Note: These are my personal solutions. Original course content belongs to [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e).
